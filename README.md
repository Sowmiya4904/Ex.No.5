# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS

# Aim: 
To test and compare how different pattern models respond to various prompts (broad or unstructured) versus basic prompts (clearer and more refined) across multiple scenarios.  Analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of the generated responses 

### AI Tools Required: 
ChatGPT (or any LLM tool)

Text editor/Word/Excel for recording responses

# Explanation: 
Definition:
An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined steps that takes some input, processes it, and produces an output.

Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:

Definiteness: Each step is clear and unambiguous.

Finiteness: It must terminate after a finite number of steps.

Input: It should have zero or more inputs.

Output: It must produce at least one result.

Effectiveness: Steps should be simple enough to be carried out, ideally by a computer.

Example (Simple):
Algorithm to add two numbers:

Start

Input two numbers A and B

Add A and B → C

Display C

Stop

Applications:

Searching (e.g., Binary Search)

Sorting (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort)

Pathfinding (e.g., Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

Machine Learning models

Everyday life (recipe for cooking, steps to solve math problems)


# OUTPUT:
Scenario 1: Creative Story Generation

Naïve Prompt: “Write a story.”

Basic Prompt: “Write a short story about a young engineer who invents a smart irrigation system to help farmers in a drought-hit village. Keep it within 150 words.”

Responses:

Naïve: Very generic story, no clear theme.

Basic: Specific story about an engineer, focused on innovation, word limit respected.

Scenario 2: Factual Question Answering

Naïve Prompt: “What is AI?”

Basic Prompt: “Explain Artificial Intelligence in simple terms. Define it, list its major types, and give 2 examples of AI applications in daily life.”

Responses:

Naïve: Single-paragraph definition, very brief.

Basic: Detailed explanation with definition, types (Narrow, General, Super), and real-life applications.

Scenario 3: Summarization

Naïve Prompt: “Summarize globalization.”

Basic Prompt: “Summarize globalization in 5-6 sentences, covering its definition, economic impact, cultural influence, and pros & cons.”

Responses:

Naïve: Short, vague, one-line summary.

Basic: Balanced explanation touching economic, cultural, pros & cons in structured format.

Scenario 4: Advice/Recommendation

Naïve Prompt: “Give me advice.”

Basic Prompt: “Give me three pieces of advice for a 3rd-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student to prepare for final-year projects and placements.”

Responses:

Naïve: Very generic life advice (work hard, stay positive).

Basic: Practical career-focused advice (work on IoT/embedded projects, strengthen coding, prepare for interviews).

# RESULT: 
The comparative analysis table and test results clearly show that prompt clarity directly impacts the usefulness of ChatGPT responses.[EXP5_Prompting_Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22561516/EXP5_Prompting_Analysis.pdf)
